 - only the ui part has been covered in this code base for the frontend of the assignment
 - all the buttons are working 
 - this assignment contains the frontend part of the given assignment. i can write the backend code as well it if is required and asked but for 
   now, i have written the frontend codes only. 
 - Framework used - React.js 
 - React Router for smooth routing 
 - since no backend is provided so there is no form validation and login/logout or signup functionality(it all can be added if needed)
